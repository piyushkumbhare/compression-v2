# Compression-v2

Second version of my original compression project [here](https://github.com/piyushkumbhare/compression).

## Goals for this version

1. Revamp the entire layout of the project
2. Have all compression be byte-based (`u8`) instead of String based (`&str`)
3. Actually get to Huffman encoding

Note: Use [this website](https://huffman-coding-online.vercel.app/) to check Huffman Trees
